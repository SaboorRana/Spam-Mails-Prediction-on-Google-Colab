The Spam Mail Prediction project is designed to classify email messages as either spam or non-spam (ham) using machine learning techniques. This project processes a dataset of emails, extracting key features such as word frequency, email length, and other linguistic patterns to determine the likelihood of an email being spam. By utilizing supervised learning algorithms, the model is trained on labeled email data to learn the differences between spam and legitimate emails. Once trained, the model is capable of accurately predicting whether a new email is spam or not, helping users to filter out unwanted messages automatically.

Key features of the project include preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction to enhance the model's performance. The project uses techniques like Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to quantify word importance and classify emails effectively. It also leverages various classification algorithms, such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to improve accuracy. With proper model evaluation, such as cross-validation and confusion matrix analysis, the project ensures that the spam filter is both robust and reliable in real-world applications.
